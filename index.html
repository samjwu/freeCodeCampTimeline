                    "freeCodeCamp is my effort to correct the extremely inefficient and circuitous way I learned to
                    code. I'm committing my career and the rest of my life towards making this process as efficient and
                    painless as possible. [...] All those things that made learning to code a nightmare to me are things
                    that we are trying to fix with freeCodeCamp"
